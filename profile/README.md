This is about:source and about us. Established in 2011 – since then we have
specialized in building perfectly fitting software for our customers –
mostly non-governmental organizations. We develop tools that help them to
create political, ecological and social change. We value technical quality
and (data-) security. What sets us apart: we consciously decide who we work
for.

#### about:work

We work together in an agile manner for our projects. Key word: [SCRUM](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html). Our code is on Github and is
checked for errors using Github Actions before the obligatory code review.
For our continuous integration we also use code reviews and pull requests. We
want to put sustainable code on the Internet and therefore love it
pragmatic and clean.

Besides that, we also pay a lot of attention on how to work at
about:source. We are constantly developing our collective structures - flat
hierarchies’ matter to us. To make these work, we rely on transparency and
mutual trust. Showing this through an open communication with each other,
where everybody is getting heard. We pay attention to individual needs.
Once a month we meet for a full day team meeting to discuss future
projects. Once a year we take a few days to reflect on working together and
discuss the strategic direction of about:source.

#### What about:you?

Aside from being part of the open source world, we are also open to new
faces and have a few [job postings](https://www.aboutsource.net/jobs.html)
on our website. We’re looking forward to your ideas!
